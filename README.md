# TheMages CMS
This is "TheMages CMS". I created long time ago in 2011, for now the project is more or less stable and I worked in SVN all my time, so decided to make the switch.  

Currently I'm trying to make workable through composer as I spent hours and days trying to think of a way to make easy updates.
TheMages CMS is my hobby mostly and I just found many existing CMS too bulky or hard to understand, I don't think that my CMS is some kind of solution for this, but for me it's more or less understandable obviously because I wrote it. Since the beggining I always tried to understand "how it works" and not just take created huge library, use part of it without deep knowledge.  

It's 2015 and I still spending time on this CMS and improve it whenever I have time and motivation to do so. But mostly it's right now my "sand-box" where I implement new features that I'm interested in. I wrote bunch of plugins for this CMS while working as a freelancers on bunch of projects for 3 years. But for now, while TheMages CMS is another "unknown CMS" I don't intend to make it super-pretty highly modular.  

If you find this project interesting I wouldn't mind you to join and contribute or just give ideas what could be made to make it better.
