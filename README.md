# The M.A.G.E.S. CMS
This is "The M.A.G.E.S. CMS". I created long time ago in 2011, for now the project is more or less stable and I worked in SVN all my time, so decided to make the switch.  

Currently I'm trying to make workable through composer as I spent hours and days trying to think of a way to make easy updates.
The M.A.G.E.S. CMS is my hobby mostly and I just found many existing CMS too bulky or hard to understand, I don't think that my CMS is some kind of solution for this, but for me it's more or less understandable obviously because I wrote it. Since the beggining I always tried to understand "how it works" and not just take created huge library, use part of it without deep knowledge.  

It's 2015 and I still spending time on this CMS and improve it whenever I have time and motivation to do so. But mostly it's right now my "sand-box" where I implement new features that I'm interested in. I wrote bunch of plugins for this CMS while working as a freelancers on bunch of projects for 3 years. But for now, while The M.A.G.E.S. CMS is another "unknown CMS" I don't intend to make it super-pretty highly modular.  

If you find this project interesting I wouldn't mind you to join and contribute or just give ideas what could be made to make it better.

## Where is master branch?
Because I'm working alone and there are no contributions (yet?) there is no need for bunch of branches. Plus tagging is the most important part as installation update goes through composer.

## Instalation
The best and easiest way to install CMS is through composer. It will allow you to keep up with updates. This is the best choise if you want to only develop your own modules, without touching core files.
